# Map List Pro Geocoding
Wordpress plugin that adds geocoding capabilities to Map List Pro (http://codecanyon.net/item/map-list-pro-google-maps-location-directories/2620196)

Adds "Geocoding" and "Geocoding Settings" menu items to Map List Pro menu.

-- Geocodoing: Select to geocode all locations or just those without coordinates. Shows any errors with links to repair locations data and then resubmit items with errors for geocoding. Runs over asynchronously so the only limit on number of locations is Google's geocoding request limit.

-- Geocoding Settings: Place to enter the Google Geocoding API Key that can be obtained at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro
